2.  ./Examples/fischer.3.c.ba

The Running Time 1: 
Parallelism level of the custom pool: 8, and the current active threads: 0
--------------------------------------------------
Time used(ms) for Sequential Version: 4208 ms.
Time used(ms) for Parallel Version: 5025 ms.

Correct! The calculated parallel result is the same as the sequential result!
